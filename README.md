# Style Guide

In this project, I created a style guide/design system for your website.
This is a CodeAcademy project for the Front-end Engineer Career Path.

I used HTML and CSS.

#### What I've practiced/learned:
- Create a style guide;
- Anchor to the same page (HTML);
- Add an external font type (CSS);
- Flexbox (CSS);
- Hover effects(CSS);
